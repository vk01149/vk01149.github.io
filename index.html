<h1>MY FAVORITE ANIMALS</h1>	
	<p>
		<img src="animals.gif" alt="animals" width="200" height="150" style="float:right">
		There are many types of animals.Categories often used to classify animals are ivertebrates, fish, amphibians, birds, 
		reptiles, and mammals. Invertebrates do not have a backbone. Fish use their gills to breathe. Amphibians live in both 
		the water and on land. Reptiles are cold blooded. Birds are warm blooded and have feathers. Mammals have either hair 
		or fur.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of my favorite animals include mini pigs, goats, dogs, and tigers. Mini pigs are a stunted version 
		of traditional pigs and are often kept as pets just as dogs are. On the other hand, tigers and goats are typically 
		not held as pets as keeping a tiger as a pet can be quite dangerous. Additionally, many neighborhoods do not allow
		people to keep farm animals such as goats as pets. 
	</p> 
	<p> I want to have a lot of pets one day because pets are fun. I feel that pets teach children responsibility. Therefore,
		I would like to have a plethora of pets such as dogs, cats, and a mini pig too. I might even want to live on a farm one
		day. If I do end up living on a farm, I would like to have a few horses too. For more information on animals
